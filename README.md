This HTML slide deck is using cutting-edge CSS features for demonstration purposes.
It is intended to be presented in a controlled environment.

You may try to replicate that environment by running
[Google Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html)
with the _Experimental Web Platform features_ flag enabled in `chrome://flags`.
